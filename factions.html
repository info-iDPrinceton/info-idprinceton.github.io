                                Severus Mossy Beard the Wise. A wise wizard but unfit to be king, Severus’ lack of crownly leadership and doddering oldness has resulted in discord and war throughout the land of iD Tech Princeton. Into this void has stepped many a combatant seeking glory, treasure, and even the soul of iD Princeton itself. Who will be the victor? Find out this week in season 2 of Camp of Thrones.

                                House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties. It is also the current royal house of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing.
                                Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. As the new royal house, they also rule directly over the Crownlands from their seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing, the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words are "Hear me roar!", which is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.

                                Swackhammer (Danny DeVito), an evil alien theme park owner, needs a new attraction at Moron Mountain. When his gang, the Nerdlucks, heads to Earth to kidnap Bugs Bunny (Billy West) and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine their fate. The aliens agree, but they steal the powers of NBA basketball players, including Larry Bird (Larry Bird) and Charles Barkley (Charles Barkley) -- so Bugs gets some help from superstar Michael Jordan (Michael Jordan). Join him by joining the Tune Squad. We have Michael Jordan and Bill Murray.

                                The Fruit Punchers find joy in smashing pumpkins or breaking open a ripe watermelon at the beach. We indulge in a bit of violence here and there, but are in it for the fun, not because of any bad intentions. Our faction loves all things sugary, and would prefer Sour Patch Watermelon or Peach Rings over any real fruit (Except maybe chocolate-covered strawberries. Those are amazing). We are easily amused by explosions and destroying fruit, and excel at Fruit Ninja. Sometimes we forget that we are even aiming for the throne, as we are too busy crushing Runts and Lemonheads in our mouths. Our greatest wish is to take over iD Princeton and spread our love of sweets and innocuous violence!

You’re probably thinking something like, “Sloth, what the heckie, that’s not how space works” and to that I say “Listen? No?” It’s a really chill time, to be honest? We have a hot chocolate machine? Also, we have baby sloths, kittens, and puppies floating around with us? And beanbag chairs? Lots of video ĝames too? If you wanna chillax and not die, The Martians? is the faction for you?

                                Based in Farron Keep, the Abyss Watchers are a group of Undead warriors who acted in the dark, seeking out any sign of the Abyss, fighting a constant war with its abominations. They "vowed to partake of wolf blood". Slightly ironic, or possibly on purpose, as Artorias the Abysswalker's companion was Great Grey Wolf Sif.
                                Being of Farron, they were lonesome warriors proficient with the sword, and relied only on more pragmatic spells. It is unknown whether one or all of the Abyss Watchers linked the fire. Perhaps they worked as a team to push back the darkness. But, they were betrayed by the Fire. The wolf blood that bound them to one another dried up, and Farron "was consumed by a festering wood".
                                The very power the Abyss Watchers drew from to combat the Abyss evaporated in the fire. Their home grew acrid, and the allies they left behind were warped into inhuman creatures. Worse yet, the Abyss was left unchecked, and now Darkwraiths roam freely in Farron, an affront to everything the Abyss Watchers stood for. When the Abyss Watchers awoke and saw what had become of their home, they were overcome with anger so intense it was maddening, or perhaps the encroaching darkness took control of them. Now the watchers sit on the doorstep of the darkness they once sought to extinguish present in the Catacombs of Carthus.

                                The Faceless Men are an organization based in the Free City of Braavos, though their members range far and wide across both Essos and Westeros. They are reportedly a guild of assassins who command exorbitant fees, but have a reputation for success that is unparalleled by any comparable organization.

                                They consider themselves servants of the Many-Faced God, a god of death who is unknowingly worshipped by all religions in the world, in the form of one god or another. The weirwood Face for the Old Gods of the Forest and the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven are two such deities. Faceless Men are trained to relinquish their former identities and become "no one", which allows them to become entirely different people, all in service to the Many-Faced God. They also believe that, as servants of death, they must serve above all else and that they must deliver upon certain people the "gift" of death.

                                The Faceless Men possess the ability to physically change their faces, shapeshifting so that they appear as an entirely new person.

                                Their headquarters are located in the House of Black and White, a temple dedicated to the Many-Faced God.

Anyone who stands in our way will perish in a sea of orange with waves high enough to destroy even the mightiest of soldiers. With our wit, strength, and allies, we will conquer the realm of iDTech Princeton.

                                “All hail the Beard,” for it is truly mighty and is able to withstand the onslaught of those who injure and inflict mayhem on others. Stories of past mention the once barren land that was IdPrinceton, where pain and death had taken over; yet, it was ThornHawke and his great beard of healing that took a stand. He was able to push back the long dreaded blackness, that called itself death, and thus the people of the great land greet him with their pledge devotion. With the darkness still lingering and death gaining the strength to raise again the Mage of Banage - Aid has been called forth once more in hopes of returning the land back into life.
