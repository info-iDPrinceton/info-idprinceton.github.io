                                House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its
                                richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties. It is also the current royal
                                house of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing.
                                Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive
                                rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications
                                built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens
                                of the West. As the new royal house, they also rule directly over the Crownlands from their
                                seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing, the traditional seat of the royal family. House
                                Lannister's Heraldry consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words
                                are "Hear me roar!", which is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known
                                as the official one, is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and
                                mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.

                                 Mountain. When his gang, the Nerdlucks, heads to Earth to kidnap Bugs Bunny (Billy West)
                                 and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine their fate.
                                 The aliens agree, but they steal the powers of NBA basketball players, including Larry
                                 Bird (Larry Bird) and Charles Barkley (Charles Barkley) -- so Bugs gets some help from

                                Based in Farron Keep, the Abyss Watchers are a group of undead warriors who acted in the dark,
                                seeking out any sign of the Abyss, fighting a constant war with its abominations.
                                They vowed to partake of wolf blood. Being of Farron, they were lonesome warriors
                                proficient with the sword, and relied only on more pragmatic spells. It is unknown whether one or
                                all of the Abyss Watchers linked the fire. Perhaps they worked as a team to push back the darkness.
                                But, they were betrayed by the Fire. The wolf blood that bound them to one another dried up, and Farron
                                was consumed by a festering wood. The very power the Abyss Watchers drew from to combat the Abyss
                                evaporated in the fire. Their home grew acrid, and the allies they left behind were warped into inhuman
                                creatures. Worse yet, the Abyss was left unchecked, and now Darkwraiths roam freely in Farron, an affront
                                to everything the Abyss Watchers stood for. When the Abyss Watchers awoke and saw what had become of
                                their home, they were overcome with anger so intense it was maddening, or perhaps the encroaching darkness
                                took control of them. Now the watchers sit on the doorstep of the darkness they once sought to extinguish
                                present in the Catacombs of Carthus.

                                The Faceless Men are an organization based in the Free City of Braavos, though their
                                members range far and wide across both Essos and Westeros. They are reportedly a guild
                                of assassins who command exorbitant fees, but have a reputation for success that is
                                unparalleled by any comparable organization.

                                They consider themselves servants of the Many-Faced God, a god of death who is unknowingly
                                worshipped by all religions in the world, in the form of one god or another.
                                Faceless Men are trained to relinquish their former identities
                                and become "no one", which allows them to become entirely different people, all in service
                                to the Many-Faced God. They also believe that, as servants of death, they must serve above
                                all else and that they must deliver upon certain people the "gift" of death.

                                The Faceless Men possess the ability to physically change their faces, shapeshifting so
                                that they appear as an entirely new person.

                                Their headquarters are located in the House of Black and White, a temple dedicated to the
                                Many-Faced God.

                                of sherwood forest often provide food, shelter, protection, and even money for the poor
                                and needy. Though they are known for staying out of political and territory disputes,
                                Robin Hood may join a cause that he deems just. At the end of the day, justice must prevail
                                and even the poor and weak must have a voice. Join the cause of Robin Hood and his merry men
                                and women if you believe in keeping the powerful honest and just.
