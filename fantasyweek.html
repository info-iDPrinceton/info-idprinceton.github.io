            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>War has come to iD Tech Camps Princeton. The chaos began when the Mad King and Grand Wizard Severus Mossybeard 
                the Wise declared that wakeup would henceforth be set at a firm 6:30am. Unable to cope with the lack of sleep 
                and made distraught by further unreasonable demands, the lords of the great houses became doubtful of their king’s 
                sanity. Battle lines were drawn across the once unified empire and whispers of uneasy alliances can be heard in the
                halls of Castle Frist. With the current monarchy on the brink of shattering it will be up to the people of 
                iD Tech Princeton, as well as the strategic maneuvers of their lords and ladies, to determine the fate of this great kingdom.

            <h1>Tuesday PM</h1>
            <p>In the morning of tuesday it was the Abyss Watchers who chose to strike. They sent their full force north 
                towards the well defended encampment of the Fruit Punchers. While Sunny D fought bravely, she was no match 
                for the giant Wolf of Farron and her fortifications were annihilated. On the run and outnumbered she retreated
                to her war camp with Hatter close at her heels. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As hatter turned around to cheer on his forces, invigorated by his sound victory, his expression changed to one of 
                horror. His home, Forbes Village, was ablaze and the culprit was none other than Mango(e)s. Man certainly 
                did go to war. Fruit Salad had seized the opportunity to assault the Abyss Watchers’ undefended territory.
                Unable to complete his siege, Hatter had no choice but to retreat. Swinging back to rally at Forbes he was
                barely able to repel the ensuing attack. Mango(e)s left Hatter and his army devastated.
                Meanwhile the Death Knights and House Lannister fortify Castle Frist so as to be able to withstand future onslaught.
                <br>
                <br>
                While both the Fruit Punchers and the Abyss Watchers remain in the game, it is clear that they are not as strong as 
                they once seemed. The west is on fire and ripe for the taking. Will the campers aid the flailing factions
                of the Fruit Punchers and Abyss Watchers? Will they join with their surrounding rivals and assist in 
                completing Mango(e)s sinister plot for world domination? Or will they bring their banners elsewhere entirely?

            <h1>Tuesday AM</h1>
            <p>The Mad King Severus Mossybeard took things too far on Monday night. With Shmog and his Dracoliches marching on the 
                capital to take the throne, the Grand Wizard became desperate. He made threats to make wake up even earlier, raise 
                ticket taxes, and ban video games for the rest of the week. As the Death Knights drew closer to his keep the Grand 
                Wizard began his most insane plan yet, destroying every laptop with his Wildfire_Virus.exe. His friend and most loyal
                Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister, watched on as his Mad King prepared to destroy everything the campers of iD Tech Princeton 
                had worked to build. The night came to a climactic close with Shmog bursting through the keep doors, sword in hand, ready 
                to slay the king and take over camp. Severus was prepared as he stood before Shmog with his hand on the button. He 
                claimed he would annihilate the projects and delete all backups. The Lich King, while powerful enough to defeat his opponent, 
                did not think it would be worth the great loss and found himself at an impasse. Before he could make his next move, 
                the Mad King was felled by his Kingsguard Jaime and the projects were left unharmed. Jaime earned the name Kingslayer 
                but truly believes that his decision was necessary for the good of the kingdom. When the dust of battle settled it was 
                clear that The Lich King’s goal to take over the Apothecary (south of Frist) was successful. House Lannister now controls 
                Castle Frist and is working to restore order to the realm. Hear Me Roar.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Castle Frist lay under siege, overtaken by chaos and destruction, a powerful alliance is being built between the
                Bearcepticons, Toon Squad, and House Jumbo. They have chosen to remain passive for now, observing the other houses and
                waiting for the right time to join the fray.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Great Wolf of Farron has joined forces with The Fallen Retro Emperor and together they hope to claim the throne
                for themselves. Dash was once a great ruler and he believes this alliance will allow him to take yet another throne.
                Their forces are geographically separated and they have decided to watch the war rage on from afar… for now.
                <br>
                <br>
                The forces of the east led by Nash (he’s a good guy) and Stitch have decided to fortify their borders in hopes that
                the storm of battle will pass. It seems the two have also recruited the help of a western mercenary group known as
                the Fruit Punchers, a slightly less passive faction that seeks only to bruise as many fruits as possible. Will Mango(e)s
                and Ape indeed be punched or will these great houses be brought into the larger melee?
                <br>
