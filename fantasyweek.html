        <br>
        <p>House Jumbo is located in the Bay of Pythons,
          <br>formerly enslaved by Semicolons. Ruled by the amiable Lady Jumbo, the first of her name,
          <br>Debugger of Code, and Mother of Pythons. We have a lot of Space which is important to us.
          <br>We are a high-level, general-purpose, dynamic, and well-interpreted people. Pythons are
          <br>some of the largest snakes, and use constriction to take down their prey, just like lady Jumbo,
          <br>“Pythons can be difficult to find and watch long enough to learn their habits.” We admire
          <br>the Python for its strength, versatility, and readability.<br>

        <h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: #ffffff;">House Lannister - D-Dog</h3>
        <br>
        <p>House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros,
          <br>one of its richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties.
          <br>It is also the current royal house of the Seven Kingdoms following the
          <br>extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing.
          <br>Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is Casterly Rock,
          <br>a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations
          <br>and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount
          <br>of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. As the new royal house, they also rule
          <br>directly over the Crownlands from their seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing,
          <br>the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry consists of a
          <br>golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words are "Hear me roar!", which
          <br>is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one,
          <br>is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly
          <br>in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.
          <br>UNLESS IT IS MAKING A GAME FOR JUMBO, THEN DEBTS REMAIN UNPAID

          <br>(Billy West) and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine

          <br>some help from superstar Michael Jordan (Michael Jordan). Join him by joining the Tune Squad.

        <br>
        <p>Join the Dark Side. Led by the Arch Sorceress of Badstuff  we leave nothing but ash,
          <br>darkness, and chaos in our wake. With our magical fireballs we burn, poison, melt,
          <br>and zombify the competition. Nothing can stand up before our evil magical might.
          <br>If you choose to be a sorcerer(ess) you will wield magics that boggle the mind of mere muggles.

        <h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: #ffffff;">The Fruit Punchers - Sunny D</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Led by Sunny of Orange, the Fruit Punchers find joy in smashing pumpkins or breaking open a ripe watermelon at the beach.
          <br>We indulge in a bit of violence here and there, but are in it for the fun, not because of any bad
          <br>intentions. Our faction loves all things sugary, and would prefer Sour Patch Watermelon or
          <br>Peach Rings over any real fruit (Except maybe chocolate-covered strawberries. Those are amazing).
          <br>We are easily amused by explosions and destroying fruit, and excel at Fruit Ninja.
          <br>Sometimes we forget that we are even aiming for the throne, as we are too busy crushing Runts and
          <br>Lemonheads in our mouths. Our greatest wish is to take over iD Princeton and spread our love of
          <br>sweets and innocuous violence!

          <br>Together, the Bearcepticons are fighting to become the greatest robotic army in the land of iD Princeton.
          <br>The charisma of Sir Bolt of Lightning is unmistakeable, and he leads his army into battle with determination,
          <br>dedication, and strategy.  Our faction is just as strong as robots themselves, and if not, then tougher!
          <br>Join him in conquering the power to make a difference, and re-program the future of Camp of Thrones this week!

        <br>
        <p>The Martians are led by Sloth, Queen of Mars. We float around the vast, expanse of space? We just kinda hang out? Not really about this whole “chaos” thing
          <br>everyone’s talkin’ about? You’re probably thinking something like, “Sloth, what the heckie, that’s not
          <br>how space works” and to that I say “Listen? No?” It’s a really chill time, to be honest? We have a hot
          <br>chocolate machine? Also, we have baby sloths, kittens, and puppies floating around with us? And beanbag
          <br>chairs? Lots of video ĝames too? If you wanna chillax and not die, The Martians? is the faction for you?

          <br>(an undead dragon) possess immeasurable power and the ultimate gift, immortality. The price is your soul,
          <br>but the benefits are limitless. With control over both fire and death we will destroy any and all who stand
          <br>in our way. iD Tech Princeton will be ours. We are legion, we are unstoppable, and we are coming.

        <h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: #ffffff;">A Faction Has No Name  - Blank</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Faceless Men are an organization based in the Free City of Braavos, though their members range far
          <br>and wide across both Essos and Westeros. They are reportedly a guild of assassins who command exorbitant
          <br>fees, but have a reputation for success that is unparalleled by any comparable organization.
          <br>
          <br>They consider themselves servants of the Many-Faced God, a god of death who is unknowingly worshipped
          <br>by all religions in the world, in the form of one god or another. The weirwood Face for the Old Gods of
          <br>the Forest and the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven are two such deities. Faceless Men are trained to r
          <br>elinquish their former identities and become "no one", which allows them to become entirely different people,
          <br>all in service to the Many-Faced God. They also believe that, as servants of death, they must serve above
          <br>all else and that they must deliver upon certain people the "gift" of death.
          <br>
          <br>The Faceless Men possess the ability to physically change their faces, shapeshifting so that they appear
          <br>as an entirely new person.
          <br>
          <br>Their headquarters are located in the House of Black and White, a temple dedicated to the Many-Faced God.

                  <br>
                  <p>Based in Farron Keep, the Abyss Watchers are a group of Undead warriors who acted in <br>the dark, seeking out any sign of the Abyss, fighting a constant war with its <br>abominations. They "vowed to partake of wolf blood". Slightly ironic, or possibly on <br>purpose, as Artorias the Abysswalker's companion was Great Grey Wolf Sif.
                  <br>Being of Farron, they were lonesome warriors proficient with the sword, and relied only <br>on more pragmatic spells. It is unknown whether one or all of the Abyss Watchers linked <br>the fire. Perhaps they worked as a team to push back the darkness. But, they were <br>betrayed by the Fire. The wolf blood that bound them to one another dried up, and <br>Farron "was consumed by a festering wood".
                  <br>The very power the Abyss Watchers drew from to combat the Abyss evaporated in the fire. <br>Their home grew acrid, and the allies they left behind were warped into inhuman creatures. <br>Worse yet, the Abyss was left unchecked, and now Darkwraiths roam freely in Farron, an <br>affront to everything the Abyss Watchers stood for. When the Abyss Watchers awoke and <br>saw what had become of their home, they were overcome with anger so intense it was <br>maddening, or perhaps the encroaching darkness took control of them. Now the watchers sit <br>on the doorstep of the darkness they once sought to extinguish present in the Catacombs of <br>Carthus.</p>

<p>Some think of them as thieves, but many rely on them to survive, as the Merry men <br>and women of sherwood forest often provide food, shelter, protection, and even <br>money for the poor and needy. Though they are known for staying out of political <br>and territory disputes, Robin Hood may join a cause that he deems just. At the end <br>of the day, justice must prevail and even the poor and weak must have a voice. <br>Join the cause of Robin Hood and his merry men and women if you believe in <br>keeping the powerful honest and just.</p>
