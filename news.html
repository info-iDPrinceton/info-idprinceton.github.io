		<h1>NEWSLETTER THURSDAY</h1>
			<p>	In a drastic turn of events, the ghosts plaguing iD Tech Princeton took a large hit on Wednesday as more clues were revealed throughout the house. All three of the busts were successful, revealing that Shmog, Bolt and Diamond were taken by the ghosts. In a show of compassion, Diamond made a plea for redemption and another chance to be human, just before a Shmog-Bolt ghost tried attacking the camp. Feeling her remorse, the Ghostbusters voted to sacrifice their PKE Scan and bring Diamond back into the game as a human.

	Before the day was over, Space Jam went on a covert mission to acquire new clues about the new ghost added the day before. Though vague, the clues were: Rockclimbing, Rocket League, and Amiibos. In addition to these clues, the candles at the front of the house has changed since the beginning of the game as well, though the meaning of the change is unclear.

	Last night three more ghosts were added to the game, but there’s still a chance to win. Covert intelligence has revealed that they are planning something big, as resources have moved around in unpredictable patterns. As the end of Halloweek draws near, it may be a moment of reckoning for not only the Ghostbusters of iD Princeton, but for the United States, the world, and the intergalactic Alliance...

		<h1>NEWSLETTER WEDNESDAY</h1>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHalfway through this exciting ghost hunt this week, none of the ghosts have been found, despite the many leads that have unfolded. With mounting pressure from authorities and a growing celestial presence, the iD Tech Ghostbusters are acquiring new tools to help their hunt. A PKE Meter has arrived to scan instructors and identify the ghost imposters once a day. Dash Retro has called in support from his Intergalactic Alliance to provide a cure potion for wrongly busted instructors. This means that Hatter, Awesome and Iron were busted on day 2 but they still have a chance. Because Hatter was busted, his clues were lost.
</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn day 3 there are two more ghosts, making a total of 6 in camp. Donovan’s prize revealed a clue that there were no ghosts present at Monday night’s casino event. Blue fire candles throughout the house have revealed the majority of several clues that can be overviewed on the website along with the videos and PKE rules.

		<h1>NEWSLETTER TUESDAY</h1>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDay 2 of our Ghostbusters investigation and things haven’t gone the way we wanted it so far. Our only eye witness, Hawke, is still missing on his birthday, and our first attempt at busting a ghost (Mangoes) led to a lawsuit. In order to prevent another mistake, Iron has called the big gun, POTUS, our fine President to help move things along. Hopefully the PKE Meter will arrive in the next few hours. Busters, be sure to be weary of who you vote to bust because if you bust the wrong instructor, the PKE meter may never reach them and we won’t have the tool to use.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough Mangoes lived through the ordeal, his brief coma erased his memory of the attack yesterday, and he is too angry with us to offer any help. All that we know about the attack is that Mad Hatter allegedly found him and brought him to the labs before he was able to utter part of a word, “Ha-” before passing out.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBack at square one, the only evidence we have so far is the video from Hawke's phone, and the riddle suggesting that there are "4 candles lit inside the house". In addition, some of Junior Ghostbusters (campers) have found pieces of clues throughout the labs and Canada (Shmogland)...
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThree Instructors have been commissioned to investigate secret leads for clues that cannot be revealed until later today. Be careful not to bust the wrong instructors or you may never learn what they find. Spend time talking to them throughout the day to try and find some leads.
		</p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKeep being diligent and keep your eyes peeled. These ghosts are sneakier than we anticipated and we will need all the help we can get to bust them.
