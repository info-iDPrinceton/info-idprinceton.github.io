		<h1>NEWSLETTER TUESDAY</h1>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDay 2 of our Ghostbusters investigation and things haven’t gone the way we wanted it so far. Our only eye witness, Hawke, is still missing on his birthday, and our first attempt at busting a ghost (Mangoes) led to a lawsuit. In order to prevent another mistake, Iron has called the big gun, POTUS, our fine President to help move things along. Hopefully the PKE Meter will arrive in the next few hours. Busters, be sure to be weary of who you vote to bust because if you bust the wrong instructor, the PKE meter may never reach them and we won’t have the tool to use.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough Mangoes lived through the ordeal, his brief coma erased his memory of the attack yesterday, and he is too angry with us to offer any help. All that we know about the attack is that Mad Hatter allegedly found him and brought him to the labs before he was able to utter part of a word, “Ha-” before passing out.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBack at square one, the only evidence we have so far is the video from Hawke's phone, and the riddle suggesting that there are "4 candles lit inside the house". In addition, some of Junior Ghostbusters (campers) have found pieces of clues throughout the labs and Canada (Shmogland)...
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThree Instructors have been commissioned to investigate secret leads for clues that cannot be revealed until later today. Be careful not to bust the wrong instructors or you may never learn what they find. Spend time talking to them throughout the day to try and find some leads.
		</p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKeep being diligent and keep your eyes peeled. These ghosts are sneakier than we anticipated and we will need all the help we can get to bust them.
