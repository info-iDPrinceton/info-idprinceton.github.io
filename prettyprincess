            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>War has come to iD Tech Camps Princeton. The chaos began when the Mad King and Grand Wizard Severus Mossybeard
                the Wise declared that wakeup would henceforth be set at a firm 6:30am. Unable to cope with the lack of sleep
                and made distraught by further unreasonable demands, the lords of the great houses became doubtful of their king’s
                sanity. Battle lines were drawn across the once unified empire and whispers of uneasy alliances can be heard in the
                halls of Castle Frist. With the current monarchy on the brink of shattering it will be up to the people of
                iD Tech Princeton, as well as the strategic maneuvers of their lords and ladies, to determine the fate of this great kingdom.

						<h1>Friday</h1>
					
						<p>
								The sun rises on the last day of Fantasy Week, and it rises on a barren and blighted land. Awash with exuberance from their victory C.A.M.P.F offered a place at the table of friendship to all other factions. They hoped that united they would stand a chance against Rude Camp. But,  the call for friendship was not only ignored, but attacked. . . 
							<br>
Unaware of the threat in the west Stitch and Nash sent their forces against House Lannister hoping to seize their exorbitant amounts of money and buy all the oranges in the world. Space Jam, tired of Blank assassinating people left and right sent her Toon Squad and wiped Blank and his Faceless Men off the face of the planet. 
							<br>
But, the most tragic of all is when we are betrayed by our own ( . . . bolt . . . ). Despite the hand of friendship being extended to them, Hatter and Mangoes chose to align themselves with Rude Camp in hopes of hiding from the storm rather than facing it. With their combined powers they rolled over what was left of Shmog and his Death Knights. Their dreams of surviving rude camp were not to be however. Swiftly absorbed by the plague that is The Rude Camp Hatter and Mangoes realize their mistake too little too late. iD Tech Princeton was left weakened by the instructors infighting and ripe for the taking. Now the Plague of Rude Camp, Chaos, and Badstuff rule over the land.
							<br>
What will become of our fine camp? Will C.A.M.P.F rise again to take back its ancestral home? Find out next time, in season 3 of iD Tech FANTASY WEEK!

						<h1>Thursday AM</h1>
            <p>
                War is in the air and the tables have continued to turn. Seeing the carnage all around them Dash and Jumbo chose 
                to seek greener pastures and attach rockets to the bottom of their land. Using parts from Dash’s space ship they 
                took off into the night sky. They hope to find new lands to conquer, whether on this world, or the next and To 
                boldly go where no man — where no one — has gone… before. Rumor has it that they now pilot a vaguely New Jersey 
                shaped landmass through space.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the wake of his despicable betrayal, Bolt leader of the Bearcepticons marched upon Shmog the Dracolich King’s 
                gate. Fruit Salad, his ally, chose to stay back and cover his home territory, leaving Bolt to lead the siege alone.
                It seemed that the Bearcepticons would have the numbers to finally eliminate his rival but they were caught off 
                guard by the Coalition of Allies Mutually Producing Friendship or C.A.M.P.F. As Bolt reached Shmog, flames of every
                color lit up all around him. He felt the warm embrace of chaos and mayhem deep in his gut mixed with the ice cold 
                touch of hard steel at the back of his neck. Shmog called, and the powers of friendship answered. Surrounded by the 
                combined might of POTUS’ Chaos, Blank’s Faceless Men, EssBee’s sorcerers, and Shmog’s Death Knights Bolt attempted
                to retreat to the safety of his home where he could call upon his allies. As it turns out, backstabbing people does
                not friendships make and his lands were empty of both allies and support.. Mangoes left Bolt to his fate and chose
                to guard/hang out with his loyal steed. Without backup or any recourse Bolt and his forces were vaporized and 
                nothing was left behind but ashes and memory. May Friendship reign eternal! Long live camp! Long live C.A.M.P.F!
                <br>

            <h1>Wednesday PM</h1>
            <p>
                In the wake of territories changing and factions falling, power shifts across the lands of iD Princeton. With 
                the winds of winter will come a new reign, but all the remaining forces have their own vision.
                <br>
                <br>
                House Jumbo and the House of Bro have allied their forces to march on the noble House Lannister in an attempt to stifle 
                Jaime’s rise to power. For the millions that know the faces of the Lannisters, whether in fear or love, none
                are aware of the Faceless Men who answer the call to fortify House Lannister. Together, the Faceless Men and
                House Lannister are formidable, but not unbeatable. When the smoke of battle clears, their armies are gone,
                House Jumbo and House of Bro are victorious; But the Faceless Man and Jamie Lannister have retreated to lick 
                their wounds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Wielding the largest army iD Princeton has ever known, Lord Bolt sends the Bearcepticon forces to put an end
                to the Lich King Shmog’s attempt to bring fire and death to the land.The Sorceress of Bad Stuff, Essbee 
                fortifies the Dark Lord, though it’s too little too late. As Lord Bolt is delivering the final blow, Shmog 
                and Essbee vanish faster than a flash of lightning from the battlefield to regroup and resurrect their fallen forces. The darkness gathers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, on the other side of the land, Chaos has formed a plan -or something that resembles it. The Fruit 
                Punchers, led by the royal Sunny D, are seized in the night. Though they fought valiantly, they cannot punch
                Chaos quite like they can fruit. By morning light, they are defeated and all that is left of their land is a 
                pit.
                <br>
                <br>
                The war for the throne has changed. Important lives have been lost in the telling of the story of the next great
                ruler of iD Princeton. Evil has risen, and good has answered the call to resist it. Though the rest remains 
                untold, you can still play a part. Pledge your loyalty and lend you aid to your chosen king of iD Princeton 
                Fantasy Week.

            <h1>Wednesday AM</h1>
            <p>
                The game is afoot and the tides of war are shifting. In the north, House Lannister put out a kill order for
                Iron and the MetalHeads. (Rumor has it that the Faceless Men were paid a hefty fee to carry out this request.)
                Closeby and spotting a chance to sow CHAOS, Potus and the State of Chaos lent their aid in this assassination.
                Together the Lannister army and their allies totaled 8,300 brave men and women which was a more than adequate
                number to compete against Iron’s 2,000 invigorated metal-knights. Unaware and unprepared, Iron's forces were
                swiftly eradicated. Iron himself was felled without a single glint of fear in his eyes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Simultaneously in the east, Hawke Mage of Bandage-Aid buried Arrow in a monstrous pile of 2900 BAND-AIDs. Unable
                to free themselves, Arrow and his 900 merry men drowned in a sea of Health and Safety. This move completed the
                elimination of both Iron and his last ally, decimating the old regime.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the south the forces of Fire & Death & Darkness aligned. Shmog and his Death Knights as well as the Sorceress
                of Badstuff swiftly cut a swathe through all the worst kinds of fruit. Melons, Cantaloupes, and Starfruit met their
                demise en masse. At the sight of his lands ablaze Mangoes rallies his noble steed Ape in an attempt to defend his
                fruit. Bringing 2000 to aid Mango(e)s already formidable force of 4100, it was still not enough. 6100 Death
                Knights imbued with the Power of Friendship and 2000 Sorcerers/esses wielding eldritch magics marched on the
                Banana gates and knocked them down with ease. The lands of Fruitopia are left in ruins, but Mangoes and his steed
                live to fight another day.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Tuesday PM</h1>
            <p>In the morning of tuesday it was the Abyss Watchers who chose to strike. They sent their full force north
                towards the well defended encampment of the Fruit Punchers. While Sunny D fought bravely, she was no match
                for the giant Wolf of Farron and her fortifications were annihilated. On the run and outnumbered she retreated
                to her war camp with Hatter close at her heels.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Hatter turned around to cheer on his forces, invigorated by his sound victory, his expression changed to one of
                horror. His home, Forbes Village, was ablaze and the culprit was none other than Mango(e)s. Man certainly
                did go to war. Fruit Salad had seized the opportunity to assault the Abyss Watchers’ undefended territory.
                Unable to complete his siege, Hatter had no choice but to retreat. Swinging back to rally at Forbes he was
                barely able to repel the ensuing attack. Mango(e)s had gotten what he came for, leaving Hatter and his army
                devastated.
                <br>
                <br>
                While both the Fruit Punchers and the Abyss Watchers remain in the game, it is clear that they are not as strong as
                they once seemed. The west is on fire and ripe for the taking. Will the campers aid the flailing factions
                of the Fruit Punchers and Abyss Watchers? Will they join with their surrounding rivals and assist in
                completing Mango(e)s sinister plot for world domination? Or will they bring their banners elsewhere entirely?
            </p>

            <br>
            <h1>Tuesday AM</h1>
            <p>The Mad King Severus Mossybeard took things too far on Monday night. With Shmog and his Dracoliches marching on the
                capital to take the throne, the Grand Wizard became desperate. He made threats to make wake up even earlier, raise
                ticket taxes, and ban video games for the rest of the week. As the Death Knights drew closer to his keep the Grand
                Wizard began his most insane plan yet, destroying every laptop with his Wildfire_Virus.exe. His friend and most loyal
                Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister, watched on as his Mad King prepared to destroy everything the campers of iD Tech Princeton
                had worked to build. The night came to a climactic close with Shmog bursting through the keep doors, sword in hand, ready
                to slay the king and take over camp. Severus was prepared as he stood before Shmog with his hand on the button. He
                claimed he would annihilate the projects and delete all backups. The Lich King, while powerful enough to defeat his opponent,
                did not think it would be worth the great loss and found himself at an impasse. Before he could make his next move,
                the Mad King was felled by his Kingsguard Jaime and the projects were left unharmed. Jaime earned the name Kingslayer
                but truly believes that his decision was necessary for the good of the kingdom. When the dust of battle settled it was
                clear that The Lich King’s goal to take over the Apothecary (south of Frist) was successful. House Lannister now controls
                Castle Frist and is working to restore order to the realm. Hear Me Roar.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Castle Frist lay under siege, overtaken by chaos and destruction, a powerful alliance is being built between the
                Bearcepticons, Toon Squad, and House Jumbo. They have chosen to remain passive for now, observing the other houses and
                waiting for the right time to join the fray.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Great Wolf of Farron has joined forces with The Fallen Retro Emperor and together they hope to claim the throne
                for themselves. Dash was once a great ruler and he believes this alliance will allow him to take yet another throne.
                Their forces are geographically separated and they have decided to watch the war rage on from afar… for now.
                <br>
                <br>
                The forces of the east led by Nash (he’s a good guy) and Stitch have decided to fortify their borders in hopes that
                the storm of battle will pass. It seems the two have also recruited the help of a western mercenary group known as
                the Fruit Punchers, a slightly less passive faction that seeks only to bruise as many fruits as possible. Will Mango(e)s
                and Ape indeed be punched or will these great houses be brought into the larger melee?
                <br>
                <br>
