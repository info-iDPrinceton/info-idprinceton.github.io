			<h1>PKE Meter Scan</h1>
			<p>Currently unavailable can not scan</p>
			<p>Campers vote for one instructor to scan during the last vote of each day. The following morning the results of the scan will be shared, revealing if the instructor is a ghost or a human.</p>
			<p>Campers cannot scan eliminated (busted) instructors.</p>
			<p>Campers are allowed to scan the same instructor twice if they are not eliminated from the game.</p>
			<p>If an instructor is scanned, they are revealed as they are at the time. This means that if an instructor that is a human on the day they are scanned is turned into a ghost overnight, they will be revealed as a ghost. The same instructor can still be turned into a ghost later in the week.
