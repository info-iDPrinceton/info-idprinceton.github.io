        <p><b>T</b>his morning marks a new order for iD Princeton. Last night, in a glorious turn of events for camp-kind,
          the tyrannous reign of [BLANK] was overthrown.</p>

        <p>It was widely felt that life under [BLANK's] rule had become increasingly difficult due to long work and class hours,
          strain on the ticket economy, shortened meal periods, rolling blackouts from the energy deficit, terrible weather,
          threats to shut down the local Wawa, ridiculously early wake-ups, and instability of Pokemon: GO servers.</p>

        <p>In our hearts we knew that enough was enough! But who was brave enough to stand up and defend the rights of the people?</p>

        <p>That person was Dash Retro. In a remarkable display of valor, Dash challenged President Blank to a duel.
          The fight was passionate and bloody, fought with elegant weapons from a more civilized age. With one slash of his mighty sword,
          Dash managed to cut off Blank's hand and was prepared to do what was necessary to free iD Princeton. But alas, it was not
          Blank's time just yet.</p>

        <p>While the fallen President may have used his powers to escape with his life, his stifling grasp on iD Princeton has been released to
          make way for the dawn of a new era. For who should take his place but the man who saved us? Who should be more worthy than the
          bravest of us all?</p>

        <p>It is time to celebrate our new leader! Bask in the glory of the golden age that shines over Princeton!</p>
        <p>Long Live Dash Retro: Space Hero!</p>
